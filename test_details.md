# Test details

## Passwords:

- wordpressuser on mariadb: galoshes
- "Fred Test" admin user on WordPress: testtesttest
- Application Password on WordPress: IAU8 cEuo eAb9 BNMO bv3N T0jV

## Scope

More tests to follow. The single SI test is enough to see this
running. It's coverage is amazing considering how few lines it contains.
Ideally I'd use [PyBehave](https://pypi.org/project/behave/1.2.6/) instead,
for its expressiveness.
